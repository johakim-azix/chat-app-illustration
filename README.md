## My process
I started by building the views (html, css) for mobile screens, while thinking of bigger screens; i haven't build the whole DOM structure before styling! i worked step by step.
 Once i was done building views started with full css animations and transitions, and i ended implemention javascript for some advance animations that needed some DOM manipulation. 
### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS custom properties
- CSS animations
- CSS transitions
- Flexbox
- Vanilla js

### What I learned

With this challenge, i made my first steps with animation using css, chaining them, delaying them and so on ... i also dived deeper using transitions, all this was in order to avoid building poor user experience on upcoming apps i'll work on.

### Continued development

For sure i'll keep working on adding more animations and transition on my pages. 
Till now i wasn't really using them, i didn't even know how to build some of them specially animations!!!
I was always shocked by these amazing motions i used to see on dribbble without knowing how to build them. 
But now i know them and it's amazing how they can radically change user experience.
